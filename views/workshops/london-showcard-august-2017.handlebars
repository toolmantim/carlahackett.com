      <h3>Love from previous workshops</h3>
      <div class="testimonials">
        <p>"Thank you so much for the wonderful weekend of learning! I was thoroughly challenged, but pleased with my progress and really thankful to have the opportunity to learn from an experienced master like Barbara." – Ruby</p>
        <p>"I have been doing a myriad of workshops this year all focusing on learning hand made type and last weekend was by far the most informative, inspiring and relaxed of these workshops. Limiting the class to a handful of people and having the workshop take place over two days were contributing factors as this allowed real one on one time with Barbara and gave us more time to focus on each style. The workshop didn't feel rushed which so many do. This created a real enthusiastic and excited energy around the table, a real positive learning space. Barbara's enthusiasm and skill were infectious which made you want to dive in and explore fully the new techniques being shared. I would highly recommend this workshop to anyone interested in broadening their skills and knowledge of brush type." – Tricia</p>
        <p>"It gave me the inspiration to pick up a brush for the first time to build some lettering skills. The process in the class was one of little break throughs and then plateaus and even back slides! But through the roller coaster Barbara gave us calm assistance and an unfailing belief that we could attain the skills. Watching Barbara brush her letters was an absolute treat." – Mary</p>
