# Rails Girls Sydney

[Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) aims to teach women, who may be intimidated by the male dominated nerd community, how to write software using the tool [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). The organisers asked us to design a type-based t-shirt for the attendees of their first Sydney workshop.

The fun but feminine ‘Ruby’ is a nod to the programming language they learnt on the day.
