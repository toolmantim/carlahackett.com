# Ladies of Letters Workshop

Love lettering? Love letterpress? Love learning? Then this workshop is for you.

This is an exclusive opportunity to learn the art of both lettering and letterpress with the Ladies of Letters. Spend a day in our beautiful light-filled studio learning how to create your own Drop Cap then come back and print it in letterpress. You will learn all about the process of both crafts in detail and take home a swag of hand-lettered, letterpress printed goodies that you create yourself. Amy and Carla both run regular lettering and letterpress workshops so we know how to bring out the creative in you.

Once you have your Drop Cap, it's time to get it on paper!
