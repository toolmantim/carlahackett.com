# I Lost my Heart to Letterpress

My studio buddy and [Ladies of Letters](http://www.ladiesofletters.com.au) compadre holds letterpress workshops every few weeks. For her [class](http://www.saintgertrude.com.au/classes/), she asked me to letter some artworks that the students can print and take home as letterpressed artworks.
