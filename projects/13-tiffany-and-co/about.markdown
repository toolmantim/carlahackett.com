# Tiffany & Co. Valentine's Day In-Store Calligraphy

For the week leading up to Valentine's Day, I set up my travelling calligraphy kit at Melbourne's Collins Street [Tiffany & Co.](http://www.tiffany.com.au/) store. I penned love notes for customers on gorgeous letterpressed stationery to give to their loved ones.
