# CSSConf Australia 2015

The team at CSSConf commissioned me for the second year of their [Australian CSS conference](http://2015.cssconf.com.au/) to create three chalk signs, including a large coffee sign featuring the sponsor (these guys like their coffee!), a way-finding A-frame and a two-sided schedule board.

The t-shirts given to volunteers and attendees featured brush-pen-style lettering with the CSS lingo “Computed Style”.
