# Letterpress Queen

Amy from [Saint Gertude](http://www.saintgertrude.com) Letterpress commissioned myself and the other Letterettes to work on a set of promotional cards that show off the skill of her printing technique. My brief was to showcase texture and so I used the brush, pencil and crayon for the Queen of Spades.
