# Ruby Conf

The [Ruby Conf](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/) crew asked us to design a Tshirt for the 200 delegates attending the inaugural conference in Melbourne.

The word 'Yield' is a Ruby term only the nerd wearing it would know, unless he is walking past a fellow nerd on the street, in which case there might be a knowing look exchanged. The 'Yield' was lettered in the Americana Baseball script style.
