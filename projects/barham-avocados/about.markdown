# Barham Avocados 

If I was stranded on a deserted island, all I would take with me is a tray of avocadoes. So it was a little dream job to create a label for [Barham Avocados](http://www.barhamavocados.com.au/) Avocado Oil bottles. The label features lettering created with a pencil to achieve a texured and simple look to match the handmade quality of their hand bottled Avocado Oil.
