# Ruby Conf

[Ruby Conf](http://www.rubyconf.org.au/) asked me to design a type-based tee to be given to each conference delegate. The idea was to make it something conference attendees would recognise and nod their head at, but at the same time being a cool tee outside of the context of the conference.

The word ‘yield’ was chosen as it’s unique to the Ruby programming language.
