# Janni and Wayne’s Wedding

Janni is a specialty paper consultant in love with all things vintage. After seeing our chalk boards in the studio she couldn’t help but commission us to do some boards for her upcoming wedding.

The concept for the boards was to add a friendly and nostalgic touch, whilst helping guests know when and where to grab a prop and a glass of bubbly.
