# Sample Coffee Roasters

[Sample Coffee](http://samplecoffee.com.au/) is a new boutique coffee raoster from Sydney. Designer [Simon Wright](http://www.simon-wright.com/), himself a coffee nerd, provided the overall strategy for the brand and gave direction for the new look and feel.

Their spunky new coffee bags now feature a stamped logo, and brush lettering of the bean's country of origin.
