# Ladies of Letters

A big-hearted collaboration with my studio buddy Amy from [Saint Gertrude](http://saintgertrude.com.au/), I am in the process of hand-lettering a full alphabet of drop caps with the artwork being lovingly letterpressed by Amy. 

The prints will be available for sale soon, with some of the proceeds being donated to the [Australian Literacy and Numeracy Foundation](https://www.alnf.org/), an organisation that aims to raise the national language, literacy and numeracy standards, especially in remote and marginalised communities. 

I can't wait to share the whole set soon!
