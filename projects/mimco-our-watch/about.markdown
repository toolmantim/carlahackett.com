# Mimco Our Watch

Mimco have paired up with Our Watch, a not-for-profit organisation dedicated to preventing domestic violence against women and children, for their second collaboration. The sales of their three new pouches embossed with the powerful phrases ‘Stand up’, ‘Enlighten’ and ‘Together’ will see 100% of the profits go towards training and educating initiatives that seek to end violence against women and children.

To launch the release of their second ‘Our Watch’ collection, Mimco commissioned me to represent The Letterettes to illustrate the words that would deliver their message in a 30 second stop motion animation featuring the new collection.
