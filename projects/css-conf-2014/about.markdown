# CSSConf Australia

The nice people organising the inaugural [Australian CSS conference](http://2014.cssconf.com.au/) needed a new brand to attract both speakers and attendees from around the world. Working with their designer I created a friendly script-style logo retaining a hand drawn feel, and a set of illustrations showcasing Melbourne's attractions.

In addition to the logo three chalk signs were made, including a large brew bar sign featuring the sponsor (these guys like their coffee!), a welcome sign to set the mood, and an a-frame to point people in the right direction.

The t-shirts given to volunteers and attendees featured brush-pen-style lettering with the CSS lingo “Computed Style”.
