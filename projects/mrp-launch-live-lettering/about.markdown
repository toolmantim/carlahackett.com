# mrp Melbourne Store Launch Live Lettering	

My list of items to do lettering on has expanded to caps! I was invited to paint lettering on caps for the launch of South African fashion label [mrp](http://www.mrp.com/en_au/) at their Melbourne Central launch. Using a super quick and textured casual style with the brush, the guests then decorated their own hat with sequins and buttons.
