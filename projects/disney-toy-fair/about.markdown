# Disney Toy Fair

[The Letterettes](http://theletterettes.com) were commissioned by the team at Born & Raised to work on-site at the Melbourne Toy Fair to bring to life the Disney Princess brand in a live lettering activation. Over four days, we painted typographic murals onto the walls of the Disney booth at the event held in the Royal Exhibition Centre in Melbourne. 

Prior to the event, we each designed a set of beautiful typographic quotes – one for each Disney Princess – that were letter-pressed onto A5 cards. During the event, passersby could choose their favourite quote and have it personalised by a us to take home as a gift.
