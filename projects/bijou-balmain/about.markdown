# Bijou Balmain

I worked with [Hoyne](http://www.hoyne.com.au/brand) Sydney on this stunning branding for a new property development Bijou Balmain. Inspired by old show posters, I created a set of brush lettered headlines that were used on bill posters, a glossy brochure and as signage in the sales office.
