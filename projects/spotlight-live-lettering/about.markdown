# Spotlight Live Lettering

Spotlight put on a beautiful Christmas in July event to showcase their products to key industry people. I created 40 original lettered artworks embellished with festive glitter and rhinestones for all guests to take home in their goodie bag. 

On the day of the event, I was set up at a station to create lettering pieces on the spot to demonstrate products.
