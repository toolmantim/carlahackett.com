# Frankie Magazine Poster 

For the 60th issue of [Frankie Magazine](http://www.frankie.com.au/), I was commissioned to create a full drop cap illustrated alphabet for their special edition fold out poster. It was a dream brief, with all the letters being hand drawn with their own unique personality to work as a suite of letters. 

The set were then turned into cute little rubber stamps for the [60th issue launch and 10th birthday bash](http://www.frankie.com.au/blogs/bits-and-bobs/frankie-birthday-bash-gallery) where party go-ers could make their own hankies to take home.
