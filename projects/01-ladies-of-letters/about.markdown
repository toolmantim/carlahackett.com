# Ladies of Letters

A big-hearted collaboration called [Ladies of Letters](http://www.ladiesofletters.com.au/) with my studio buddy Amy from [Saint Gertrude](http://saintgertrude.com.au/), I  hand-lettered a full alphabet of drop caps called 'Alphabet City' with the artwork being lovingly letterpressed by Amy. 

We made a [movie](http://www.ladiesofletters.com.au/movie) about the process and the prints are available for [sale](http://www.ladiesofletters.com.au/shop), with some of the proceeds being donated to the [Australian Literacy and Numeracy Foundation](https://www.alnf.org/), an organisation that aims to raise the national language, literacy and numeracy standards, especially in remote and marginalised communities.
