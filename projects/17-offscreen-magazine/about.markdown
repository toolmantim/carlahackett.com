# Offscreen Magazine Coaster

Kai Brach the editor and designer behind [Offscreen Magazine](http://www.offscreenmag.com/), a print magazine about the human side of websites and apps, commissioned me to create some beautiful lettering with the message ‘Coffee & Code‘ (nerds love that combo!) to go on a coaster as an insert into the magazines [6th issue](http://www.offscreenmag.com/issue6/). The lettering was printed on to 650gsm uncoated Les Naturals anthracite stock with white hot-foil-embossed lettering and it looks and feels delicious. You can buy a bundle of the coasters at the Offscreen Magazine [Paper Goods](http://www.offscreenmag.com/goods/) shop.
