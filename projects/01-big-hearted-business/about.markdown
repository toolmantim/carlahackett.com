# Big Hearted Business

Singer, songwriter, business mentor and all-round-amazing lady [Clare Bowditch](http://clarebowditch.com/) launched her [Big Hearted Business](http://bigheartedbusiness.clarebowditch.com/) early this year. The conference, events and website aim to inspire and help creative people to "Do What You Love, Make Money, and Save The World".

We were thrilled to be the first [Inspiration Bomb](http://bigheartedbusiness.clarebowditch.com/?page_id=700) artist - lettering inspiring interviews to create these video podcasts. The first was for energetic raw foodie advocate [Kemi Nekvapil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GThtarryI4Y&hd=1) and the hilarious and say-it-like-it-is [Catherine Deveney](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGDvQz7seYg&hd=1) in [two parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSi-mCo39lo&hd=1).

> “I am absolutely in love with Carla's work, SO in love that I invited her to become our very first Big Hearted Business “Inspiration Bomb Artist”. She did a wonderful job, and so said everyone. I would love to work with her again some day. ”
