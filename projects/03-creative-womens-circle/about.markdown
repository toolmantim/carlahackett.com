# Creative Womenâ€™s Circle

[Creative Women's Circle](http://www.creativewomenscircle.com.au/) invited us create a title page illustration for the upcoming second volume of [Conversations with Creative Women](http://www.creativewomenscircle.com.au/cwc-book/), due for relase November 2013.

Each title page is illustrated by a chosen Melbourne artist in their medium of choice. We produced this piece for the lovely Alischa Herrmann, a designer, printer and all-round awesome chick who runs [Bespoke&nbsp;Press](http://www.bespokepress.com.au).
