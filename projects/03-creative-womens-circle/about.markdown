# Creative Womenâ€™s Circle

We were super excited to create a title page illustration for the upcoming second volume of the [Creative Women's Circle](http://www.creativewomenscircle.com.au/) book, [Conversations with Creative Women](http://www.creativewomenscircle.com.au/cwc-book/) due for relase in November 2013. Each title page is illustrated by a chosen Melbourne artist in their medium of choice.

We were lucky enough to be invited to illustrate the title for the extremely talented Alischa Herrmann, who creates and prints beautiful things through her company [Bespoke&nbsp;Press](http://www.bespokepress.com.au).
