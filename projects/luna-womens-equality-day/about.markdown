# Women's Equality Day for LUNA Bar

The Letterettes worked on these colourful images for Women's Equality Day for LUNA Bar's Instgram and Facebook accounts. The concept had a 'strike through' theme to hightlight that these messages should not just be on one day. A great message and one that we feel strongly about!
