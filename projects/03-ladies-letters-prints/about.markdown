# Ladies of Letters Art Prints

The second addition to the [Ladies of Letters](http://www.ladiesofletters.com.au) side project with Amy from [Saint Gertrude Letterpress](http://www.saintgertrude.com.au) was the creation of this collection of wall prints for Supergraph Contemporary Art Fair.

The collection includes a set of 4 A4 split fountain prints, featuring the ridiculously popular [I Like Cats & Taylor Swift](http://www.ladiesofletters.com.au/prints/i-like-cats-and-taylor-swift) (we're just saying what you're all thinking). Under the Ladies of Letters banner, we donate a portion of all sales to the Australian Literacy and Numeracy Foundation. 

Yes, you totally can buy these. [Head over here](http://www.ladiesofletters.com.au/prints) and do it - stat!
