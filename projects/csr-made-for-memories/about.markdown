# CSR Made for Memories Cookbook	

I worked with the Melbourne agency Scooter to hand letter the campaign headline 'Made for Memories' and the cookbook's chapter pages in a chalky style. The lettering had to work alongside the [160 Year Anniversary logo](http://carlahackett.com/projects/csr-160-years-logo#project).
