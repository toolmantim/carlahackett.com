# Eric and Ursulaâ€™s Wedding

Eric and Ursula, both lovers of fine type, commissioned me to produce this suite of hand-lettered invitations for their upcoming vintage themed wedding.

The suite was letterpressed in one colour onto soft cotton Crane Lettra 600gsm stock by [The Distillery](http://www.the-distillery.com.au/) and then posted in hand-lettered envelopes unique to each guest.
