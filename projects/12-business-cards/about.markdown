# Personal Stationery 

When I created the logo for my lettering business, I could not wait to get my hands dirty and letterpress my cards. With the help of Amy from [Saint Gertrude](http://saintgertrude.com.au/), the cards are letterpressed two sides in one colour black on 450gsm Wild from KW Doggett, duplexed with Eco Luxury in four yummy pastel colours and finished with die cut rounded corners. Phew! A lot of processes involved in these little guys. If I see you on the street you'll have to beg me for one. (JK!)
