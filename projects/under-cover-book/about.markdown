# Undercover Book Cover

I was commissioned by Scribe Publishing to create this lettering for this book 'Undercover - Adventures in the Art of Editing by Craig Munro'.
The style is hand written with a brush and I also created the brushy textures on the background. Art Direction by Miriam Rosenbloom.
