# I'd Letterpress the Shit out of That Exhibition

[I'd Letterpress The Shit Out Of That](http://www.letterpresstheshitoutofthat.com) was devised in the Gold Coast Airport departure lounge. Naturally.

Typism had just wrapped for its second year. A conference featuring a swag of talented type and lettering artists sharing their skills and their stories. I had given my talk and we were waiting for planes home. Someone said something about letterpress and an exhibition was born.

The exhibition features an original piece by each artist, letterpress printed in limited edition. Swear words were encouraged.
