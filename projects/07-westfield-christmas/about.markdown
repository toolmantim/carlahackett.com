# Westfield Christmas Campaign

Working with [Moon Communications](http://moon.com.au/), I created the chalk piece “Happy Giving” for the 2013 Westfield Christmas campaign.

The lettering was created on-site and professionally photographed to retain the chalk detail, and was then used in every shopping centre's Gift Guide, along with t-shirts, ballons, signage and website.
