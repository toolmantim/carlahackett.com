# Bank of Melbourne  

Bank of Melbourne likes to keep it local and for their campaign for the Good Food and Wine Festival for 2016, they wanted to create a campaign featuring their tagline 'For the Makers' with fresh produce representing growers across the state of Victoria. 

I created the lettering concept, and it took a whole day with the help of a food stylist to build the lettering to photograph for the above-the-line campaign.
